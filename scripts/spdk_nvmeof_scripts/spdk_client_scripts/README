file 'testPagingW.sh'
- Script for conducting paging_w test in client machine
- Depends on several binaries (at least paging_w) that needs to be built up first
- Need some manual edit for selecting testing local/remote device/protocol (some TODOs in it)


file 'iscsi_client_login_server.sh'
- Used by 'testPagingW.sh' for connect remote iSCSI device
- Need manual setup ip:port and nqn name (currently hardcoded)
