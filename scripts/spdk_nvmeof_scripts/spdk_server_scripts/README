== Step 1. Clone & Build spdk ==

NOTE: Need to remove (if) installed Mellanox OFED to avoid spdk dependent component conflicts

# git clone https://github.com/spdk/spdk
# cd spdk
# git submodule update â€“init
# sudo scripts/pkgdep.sh

# ./configure --with-rdma
# make

# scripts/setup.sh
Or
# scripts/setup.sh reset

== Step 2 Run spdk process ==
Go into spdk folder, install prerequisites documented in 'spdk_setup.sh' and run it. The terminal will be occupied 
by the spdk process if not run in the background.

== Step 3 create SPDK NVMe target for client to connect ==
On a separate terminal, go into spdk folder, run 'spdk_nvmf_target.sh'.
Done, ready for client to connect.
